    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Discover the story behind CozyCup Café</p>
    <p>CozyCup --cafe as a dream in Tristan Balce kitchen, tristan a former marketing executive with a passion of coffee, would often host
        weekend gatherings where friends and family would gather over his meticulously brewed coffee. Inspired by these moments of connection
        and joy, Tristan decided to turn this passion into a reality.

        In 2024, after leaving a successful career and spending months perfecting recipes and learning the art of coffee roasting, Tristan opened
        CozyCup Coffee. This is the start of the journey to becoming a successful business coffee shop.
